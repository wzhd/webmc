webmc
=====

A media center that works by delivering web pages.

When the specific web page is accessed, webmc list files within a choosen directory. Clients will be able to choose any file and omxplayer will be invoked to open it.

Webmc is accessible to any client with a browser, including the host itself and smart phones. In this way users will be able to use many devices already at hand, no dedicated hardware remote control or special apps is needed. It's also lightweight compared to full-featured media centers which may not run smoothly on a device with limited resources.

I'm doing this for my RaspberryPi. The reason I am not using xbmc is it doesn't seem to run smoothly on my Pi which already runs quite a few services. But the real reason is just for fun! :-)  I just wrote this while learning javascript and js, so this is not well-written. Feel free to correct my mistakes!
